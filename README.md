# Home Planning Poker
![logo](docs/logo-hpp.svg)

Home Planning Poker is a platform where we can virtually simulate the well-known practice called similarly: [Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker). 
Here, we will be able to create an online room, assign the tasks we want to estimate in the session, choose our favorite deck, and finally, invite our team to estimate together.
